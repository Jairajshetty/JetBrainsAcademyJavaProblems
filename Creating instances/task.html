  <p>Packages allow you access constructors as well as static methods. </p> 
  <p>Now you're working with the application that multiplies provided number by 200. There' a special class that is used for operating on large numbers called <code class="java">BigInteger</code>. </p> 
  <p>In this task, you will need to access this class <em>without importing it</em>. Its constructor accepts only one argument: string with the number (for example, "1264"). It is located in <code class="java">java.math</code> package. <br> <br> You need to create an instance of this class, with the number given in method, and return it.</p> 
  <p>The program will then multiply it, you <em>don't </em>need to perform multiplication.</p>
