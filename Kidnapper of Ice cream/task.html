  <p>Imagine now you are an outlaw in the Sherlock Holmes times. You are in need of money and you want to demand some by blackmailing. Obviously, you have to write a letter completely anonymously because you do not want to be busted.</p> 
  <p>So you decide to compose a letter by cutting the required words from a newspaper.</p> 
  <p>In this problem, you get two lines: 1) available words you have in a newspaper, 2) your note.</p> 
  <p>Find out and print if you can write a note from available words ("<strong>You get money</strong>") or you will be busted ("<strong>You are busted</strong>").</p> 
  <p><strong>Remember</strong>: your note is case-sensitive</p>
